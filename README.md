# React End to End project

This is the fully completed version of the React end to end project trainers will build with their students. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE** - please note that this version includes the filtering functionality and has a slightly different component structure that the project built with students during the workshop. Direct your students to this branch when they have finished working on the activity/extensions. 

If you would like to see the finished version from the workshop without the extensions, please go to the `react-end-to-end-project-completed-without-extensions` branch of this repo. 

## Using this repo
